## What are treats?

Treats are fanworks that you receive <u>in addition to</u> the one which was
assigned to be created for you. They are extra gifts! Treats are still required
to be focused on a character or ship you've asked for and to follow your DNWs,
but they can be much shorter or may only be sketches instead of clean lineart.

Treats can be gifted to more than one person; for example, if four people have
requested `Female Hawke/Varric Tethras/Sebastian Vael`, and you've drawn fanart
which doesn't violate any of their DNWs, you can treat that to all four
participants.

You could receive one treat, multiple treats, or no treats.

Treats may also be given to the exchange as a whole by placing them in the
collection and NOT completing the "Gift to" section. You can treat the
collection with ships which are on the nominations list but didn't make it to
the requests, creations which don't quite fit a single prompt (maybe the ships
were requested but there are DNWs in your creation), or treats which fit so many
prompts to gift it directly to so many participants would be cumbersome.

For more information on how to give a treat, please see
[How do I give a Treat?](#how-do-i-give-a-treat)

<Aside type="tip" icon="star">

To make sure you can receive treats, please double check your Gift settings
(especially if your AO3 account was created after 04 Feb 2022) by going to
`My Preferences` → `Collections, Challenges, and Gifts` and make sure **Allow
anyone to gift me works** is checked.

## I only want specific treats for specific prompts.

During sign-ups you can indicate what type of treats (if any) you want for each
group of ships you request. In the `Additional Tags` box, please select what
types of treats you'd be open to receiving for each prompt. You could, for
example, select `Fanfic` and `Treats - Fanart`; this would indicate that you'd
rather have fanfic for a main gift, but would accept a fanart treat.

`Treats - Other` indicates you would be willing to receive other fan creations
like fanmixes, podfic (of a new or existing story), moodboards, etc.

For more information on sign-ups please see
[Tutorials - How to Sign-up](/docs/exchange/tutorials/signups).

## This is cool and all, but... I don't want treats.

We understand. We ask that you do three things in order to help make sure you
don't receive treats:

- during Sign-Ups please make sure to click `No Treats Please` in the
  `Additional Tags` section of your sign-up on your prompts

- To be explicit, please list "Treats" as part of your
  [**Do Not Wants**](/docs/exchange/faq#what-are-do-not-wants-dnws).

- Finally, check your AO3 settings to make sure treats cannot be given outside
  of assignments. To do this, go to `My Preferences` →
  `Collections, Challenges, and Gifts` and make sure **Allow anyone to gift me
  works** is not checked.

## What does "Treatless" mean?

Treatless partcipants are ones who haven't been gifted at least one treat. Many
exchange participants like to make sure everyone gets a treat, so they work hard
to clear the Treatless List, by writing or drawing more than one piece during
the creation period. "Treatless" is our way of identifying those who haven't
gotten an extra gift yet.


## How do I give a Treat?

### To give a treat to specific recipients:

1. Go to this year's Collection and click the `Post to Collection` button
   <u>or</u> go to `New Work`.
2. In the **Associations** section of the New Work make sure:
   1. This year's collection is listed in the `Post to Collections / Challenges`
      box.
   2. You list all the recipients who you'd like to receive the work as a treat
      in the `Gift this work to` box.

You can use copy & paste to make sure you're gifting to the correct person in
the correct exchange!
