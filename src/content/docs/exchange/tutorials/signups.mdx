Sign-Ups consist of requests for which ships you want to receive content of and
offers for which ships you'd be willing to create for. Each participant may
request up to 60 ships and offer for an unlimited amount of ships.

Once sign-ups are complete you will be matched to a participant who is
requesting at least one ship you are offering to create for, and you will be
expected to create a fanwork which meets the minimum requirements outlined
[here](/docs/exchange/intro#the-basics).

Please keep in mind matches look for only **one ship** you have offered to match
to **one ship** your recipient has requested, so you may receive an assignment
where there is only one prompt you would like to write. This is fine! _You will
create a work based on this request._ The matching will also make sure that
artists are matched to people who want art and writers are matched to people who
want fic.

<Aside type="tip" icon="star">

No one can see what you have offered except the moderators. If you are inspired
by a ship or prompt that was not one you offered, you are absolutely free to
write something different!

</Aside>

**When sign-ups open go to the main AO3 profile for the exchange.** In the
left-hand sidebar you will see a link for the sign-up form. There is also a
sign-up button on the top right. Click one of these two.

## Requests

<Image src={request} alt="Request Example" />

**Enter your requests.** There will be three request forms by default. To
complete your request forms, follow the below steps:

<Steps>

1.  **Title** (_Optional_)

    Use this field to name your pairing groups, add an extra note, or even add a
    content warning like "NSFW prompts below".

2.  **Relationships**

    Put at least 1 and up to 3 nominated relationships you would like to receive
    content for. You must have at least relationship per request. These tags
    should match the tags in the tag set/nominations list _exactly_. The form
    will make suggestions from the tagset.

    To request the minimum amount of three ships, please put one relationship in
    each default form.

    <Aside type="note" icon="document">

    Your three requests should not consist of three requests which limit your
    creator to only creating your specific OC. You must have at least one
    requested ship for which you are happy to receive _any_ OC or which is canon
    characters only.

    </Aside>

3.  **Additional Tags**

    Choose what type of gifts and treats you would like to receive. Select as
    many as apply, but **please be sure not to select `No Treats Please` and a
    `Treats` option on the same request, as this is confusing!**
    - `Fanart` - you would like to receive a main gift that is fanart.
    - `Fanfic` - you would like to receive a main gift that is fanfic.
    - `No Treats Please` - you do not want to receive a treat for this prompt.
      (please be sure to mark this on every request if you want no extra gifts
      at all!)
    - `Treats - Fanart` - you are open to receiving a fanart treat.
    - `Treats - Fanfic` - you are open to receiving a fanfic treat.
    - `Treats - Other` - you are open to receiving an alternative fanworks treat
      (for example, a fanmix, podfic, etc.)

4.  **Letter/OC Info** (_Optional_)

    Feel free to link to a general or specific exchange letter here. Please see
    [On Exchange Letters](/docs/exchange/tutorials/letters) for more information
    on exchange letters.

5.  **Prompt/DNWs**

    Must be completed even if it simply says "please see letter". You can add
    DNWs, specific prompts, or whatever you'd like here. Please see
    [FAQs - What Are Do Not Wants (DNWs)?](/docs/exchange/faq#what-are-do-not-wants-dnws)
    for more info!

6.  **Optional Tags** (_Optional_)

    If you have more than 30 ships to request, please enter up to 3 more
    relationships in this field that you'd like to request.

    <Aside type="danger">

    Please note this field is a bit quirky and keep the following in mind if you
    decide to use it!
    - This field only allows **canonical** AO3 tags. Any tag which will be newly
      created in the exchange or which has not yet been wrangled cannot be
      entered here.

    - AO3 does not restrict this field to only three (3) entries. Mods will be
      checking your sign-ups to ensure that only three tags are entered. If
      there are more than three (3) we will delete additional ships without
      contacting you!

    - AO3 does not make sure these tags are in our approved tagset. Ineligible,
      non-nominated ships will be deleted without us contacting you.

    </Aside>

7.  **Add Another Request** Button (_Optional_)

    Want to request more ships? Click this button to add another request form.
    You can add up to 10 for a total of 60 ships/characters (3 in the
    Relationships field, and 3 in the Optional tags field).

</Steps>

## Offers

<Image src={offer} alt="Offer Example" />

**Enter your offers.**

You must have at least 3 offers, but there's no maximum number of offers.
However, please keep in mind that due to the way AO3 enforces it's minimum
number of ships, you will need to fill out at least three offer forms.

<Steps>

1.  **Relationships**

    Put at least 1 and up to 3 relationships that you would like to create
    content for. To offer the minimum amount of 3 ships, you should put one
    relationship in each form.
    - `Any Relationship` - Please click the "Any Relationship" button to
      indicate you're okay with creating content for ANY ship or character that
      was nominated. You should do this on all 3 Offer forms!

2.  **Additional Tags**

    Choose whether you would like to create fanart or fanfic (or either).
    **Please do not click any `Treats` related tags on your offers!**

3.  **More Info** (_Optional_)

    You can add info about people you would like to avoid being matched to with
    100% confidentiality or request that you not be matched with requests that
    only have smut or fluff or angst, etc, etc. The mods will use this
    information to ensure that you receive prompts you can create for.

4.  **Optional Tags** (_Optional_)

    Add as many nominated tags as you'd like to offer here, but please keep in
    mind that you do need to complete all three offer forms.

    <Aside type="danger">

    Please note this field is a bit quirky and keep the following in mind if you
    decide to use it!
    - This field only allows **canonical** AO3 tags. Any tag which will be newly
      created in the exchange or which has not yet been wrangled cannot be
      entered here.

    - AO3 does not make sure these tags are in our approved tagset. Ineligible,
      non-nominated ships will be deleted without us contacting you.

    </Aside>

5.  **Add Another Offer** Button (_Optional_)

    Want to offer more ships? Click this button to add another offer form. You
    can add up to 10 offers.

</Steps>

Click the `Submit` button on the bottom right hand corner and you're done!

<Aside type="tip" icon="star">

You can edit your requests and offers up until sign-ups close and the matching
begins, so feel free to adjust and change things until the last minute!

</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">

Be very careful if you edit your sign-ups. During an exchange last year we
noticed a bug where more "Additional Tags" can be selected on _Requests_ when
someone is editing. For example, Fanart may be added to your request, even
though you have only requested Fanfic. Please review your requests and offers
_very carefully_ after you edit.

</Aside>

**Thanks for your interest!**
