During a collection or exchange set-up process the moderators have the ability
to set the collection to both unrevealed and anonymous. Unrevealed works mean
that the titles are not known and no one can view the work. Anonymous means that
the authors are unknown.

As part of the fun of our exchanges, we like to reveal the works for a week, to
allow people to read, comment, and enjoy their works, while speculating on who
gave them their gift and treats. During this week long period you can reply to
comments and your identity will remain secret. Many people like to "accuse"
others of having created for them. Hilarity ensues.

Creators are revealed after the week long anonymous period. **This means any
work you add to the exchange collection will eventually reveal you as its
creator.**

But sometimes you may want to keep a work anonymous without orphaning or
abandoning the work. This allows you to still see comments, track stats, and
eventually reveal the work on your own terms if you choose to. You may want to
do this if it is a pairing or trope you don't normally write or simply because
you like the mystique.

Remaining anonymous is as simple as adding an anonymous collection to the work.
**ao3commentoftheday** wrote a great guide on anonymous collections, how to use
them, and how to remove them. You can find that guide

## FAQs About Anonymous Collections

### 1. Who runs the collections?

It's unknown who runs most anonymous collections. The people who have set them
up have created a sock account and set-up the collection. **None of the
anonymous collections are officially run by AO3.**

### 2. Can the collection owner see who created the work?

Yes. Collection owners and maintainers can see creators on works submitted to
the collection. However, the oldest anonymous collections on AO3 have been
around for a very long time and have neither been revealed or (as far as we are
aware) had any leaks concerning author anonymity.

Although we can't guarantee it, it is likely the anon sock accounts were created
and then abandoned.

### 3. Wait. They can reveal the authors if they want?

Sure. Just like we can reveal exchange participants by unchecking the "This
collections is anonymous" setting, the anonymous collection owners could do the
same thing. However, the oldest collections have been around since the early
days of AO3 without any issues so far, so there is very likely nothing to worry
about.

### 4. Can I set-up my own anonymous collection?

You can! You would need to create an AO3 sock account with an anonymous name
that couldn't be traced to you. Then create a collection named whatever you want
(preferably something well... anonymous). When setting up the collection, select
the "This collection is anonymous" setting. Add your collection to works you
wish to remain anonymous, and you're done. Your very own anonymous collection.

### 5. Will _you_ set up an anonymous collection?

_Maybe._ If there is enough interest from our event participants in having a
collection for our events that remains permanently anonymous, we'd be happy to
set a collection up.

### 6. Can you add more than one Anonymous Collection?

Absolutely. This may be a good option if you are concerned about an anon
collection potentially being compromised. You can add several anonymous
collections, so that if one is revealed or some other thing goes wrong, you have
a back-up anonymous collection.

### 7. How are anonymous collections different than orphaning?

Orphaning a work **permanently detaches** it from your AO3 account. It is
impossible to reverse. This means you will no longer receive kudos, comments, or
see the stats of the work in your profile. It is considered an alternative to
deleting the work entirely and should not be used lightly.

For more information on orphaning, please read through the
[AO3 FAQ](https://archiveofourown.org/faq/orphaning?language_id=en) carefully
before deciding to orphan. Remember you have other options which may resolve
whatever issues or worries you have about your work _before_ you orphan it:

- turning off comments
- screening comments
- blocking other users
- using Anonymous Collections

If you are having any particular issues you need to resolve, feel free to
contact the moderators so we can help you brainstorm potential solutions or
alternatives to orphaning.
