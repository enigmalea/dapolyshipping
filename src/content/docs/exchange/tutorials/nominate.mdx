# How to Nominate

Nominations are where you help the mods create the tags you want to see in the
event. Because tags may or may not exist, and can be formatted in so many
different ways, restricting the tags you can use to a tag set helps the mods
ensure a higher possibility of matching requests with offers. But we have no way
of knowing what you want and just slapping "canonical tags" on the exchange
would limit us to already existing tags. Using a Nomination process for our tag
set allows us to tailor this exchange.

**Each account can nominate up to 20 relationship tags for the exchange.**

<p role="note">
  Nominations are not an agreement to participate in the exchange. They're only
  an indication you would want to see more content for a ship.

1. When nominations are opened we post on our blog and tumblr linking to the tag
   set to be used for that year; a link is also added to this website. To start
   your tag nominations, click on the link to go to the tag set and then click
   the `Nominate` button on the top right.

2. Enter `Dragon Age - All Media Types` for your fandom selection. Enter one
   relationship per box. Please follow the below guidelines.

<Aside type="note" icon="document" title="Nomination Guidelines">

- **If there is a canonical tag that shows up as a suggestion for your
  nomination please click to add it.**
- For OC/PC characters (like the Warden, Hawke, or Inquisitor) please include a
  gender, i.e. `Male Hawke`. Nonbinary characters can be nominated using
  Nonbinary in place of the gender.
- For Warden and Inquisitor Characters, please make sure you include a last
  name, i.e. `Female Tabris` instead of `Female Warden` to indicate race and
  origin.
- **For Rook:** Please include gender and lineage and use canonical last names
  to indicate faction. For example: `Nonbinary Dwarf De Riva`. You may indicate
  you are open to other factions in your prompts/letters, but AO3 will match
  using the last name provided.
- For OCs which are not from in game backgrounds, use tags like
  `Original Male Character(s)`, `Original Female Character(s)`, or
  `Original Nonbinary Character(s)`. We would prefer these tags be as specific
  as possible so if you have a _role_ or _race_ in mind you may use things like
  `Original Male Elvhen Character(s)` or
  `Original Female Templars Character(s)`.
- Crossover ships are not allowed.
- There is a 100 character (letter) limit for your ships. If you hit the
  character limit with a nomination, please reach out to the moderators. We will
  discuss how to have you abbreviate or shorten the nomination.
- Please be sure to use AO3's basic ship guidelines:
  - '/' is to be used for romantic or sexual relationships. (Please use this for
    queer platonic relationships as well.)
  - '&' is to be used for friendships.

3. Once you have nominated all the ships you would like to nominate, scroll to
   the bottom and click the `Submit` button.

Once your nominations have been submitted, the mods will review to make sure if
they are acceptable. _If there need to be edits or clarifications made, we will
post to our blog, tumblr, Discord, and the nominations sheet with details, so
you can edit your nominations._ All accepted nominations will be added to a
nominations google sheet accessible by anyone. The nominations sheet will be
linked on the website and tumblr.

<Aside type="note" icon="document">

The mods cannot see who has nominated what tags, so we can't specifically
contact you if your nominations do not fit the guidelines. Please be sure to
watch our communications closely for any issues with nominations so that you can
make corrections!

</Aside>

We ask that you _try_ to use AO3 canonical tags for characters in your ships.
For example, `ZITHER!` is simply stylized as `Zither (Dragon Age)` on AO3. The
Moderators will check for canonical tags and misspellings in your tag
submissions. Don't be alarmed if your tag is corrected. Please be sure to check
your tags closely as they are approved and look for your tags to appear on the
**Nominations Sheet**, so you're aware if changes are made. If you have any
questions, feel free to reach out to us.

**Thanks for your interest and happy nominating!**
