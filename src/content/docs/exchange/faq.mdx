## What do you mean by "healthy polyamory"?

<dl>
  <dt>polyamory</dt>
  <dd>
    the practice of engaging in multiple romantic (and typically sexual)
    relationships, with the consent of all the people involved
  </dd>
</dl>

We promise we aren't trying to make this difficult, and we're using the broadest
senses of "healthy" and "polyamory" possible. But we'll break it down a little
more for you, just in case.

### Basics

- at least **three** (3) people involved
- **consent** - all parties involved must be willing participants. Simply put,
  that means no cheating, no coercion or forced relationships or sexual acts, no
  tricking people into the relationship, no cajoling, etc.
- **communication** - this goes hand in hand with the above and should be
  obvious, but in order to be explicit: communication about the relationship or
  sexual act must be open and honest. Obviously, we don't mean "characters can't
  lie", but when they lie they shouldn't be attempting to deceive someone about
  the relationship. For example, Solas can definitely hide that he's Fen'Harel,
  but he shouldn't be telling Cassandra he's only sleeping with her when he's
  also sleeping with Iron Bull.

### Ship Types

#### Various Poly Configurations

DA Poly Exchange allows for configurations where all parties are together, as
well as configurations where all partners are not shared.

- **Shared Partners Example:** an `Iron Bull/Male Cadash/Dorian Pavus` ship,
  where all three are dating and having sex.
- **Unshared Partners Example:**
  `Dorian Pavus/Male Trevelyan/Cassandra Pentaghast`, where the Male Trevelyan
  is dating both Dorian and Cassandra, but Dorian and Cassandra have no sexual
  contact, even though they are aware of the relationships.

Check out a more comprehensive list of possible poly configurations
[here](https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Polyamorous#Types_of_Polyamorous_Relationships).

#### Aromantic Ships

One-time threesomes or situations where a third partner only joins occasionally
are allowed. Although this is not a traditional depiction of polyamory and is
instead, polysexual, we've decided to allow for it for the below reasons:

- In order to be as inclusive as possible and to make room for OCs who are aro
  and headcanons around aro characters. Aro characters may not be interested in
  the trappings of a long-term relationship, but may be interested in having sex
  with multiple partners or being able to have sex with two partners in an
  established relationship. As long as all parties are okay with this, we
  believe this is a valid depiction of healthy polyamory.
- This is an exchange and pieces created are usually one shots, meant to be a
  small slice of a ship's story. In order to make writing shorter smut pieces
  easier and not require a lot of backstory, we decided that allowing aromantic
  ships would take some of the pressure off.
- Sometimes you just want a good threesome fic, and there's nothing wrong with
  that. Having sex with multiple partners does fall into a broader definition of
  polyamory.

#### Asexual Ships

We hope we don't have to say this, but we will just in case. Smut is not a
requirement for the exchange! You can certainly write or draw a polycule in
which sex is not a factor - which further means we welcome
[queerplatonic relationships](https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Queerplatonic_relationship)
as long as there are three or more partners.

### Other Non-traditional Multi-partner Ships

- Arranged marriage AUs where parties take on partners outside of the marriage
  are allowed as long as there is explicit consent.
- Polygamy is also fine; I mean, this is Thedas and Bioware hasn't explicitly
  said polygamy is illegal... and further this is fanfic! What is fanfic for if
  not for living out your fantasies?

<Aside type="note" icon="document" title="On Consent & Dubcon">

We are not in the business of policing kinks/fetishes or tropes. Although true
noncon/rape will not be allowed for the exchange, we have no issues with
consensual non-consent.

Further, dubcon is, by its very nature, dubious; it exists in the grey ~~with
the Wardens~~. If your throuple needs some sex pollen to break the ice, go for
it! We only ask that you abide by the rules and follow whatever DNWs are present
in your recipient's requests concerning dubcon.

</Aside>

## Wait. Can you clarify that dubcon note? You said no coercion!

As mentioned in the note, dubcon is dubious! Not everyone agrees what is dubcon
and what isn't. Sex pollen, drunk confessions leading to sex, and Fade
shenanigans could all be dubious under the right circumstances or with the right
perspective. These sorts of dubcon tropes and themes are fair game for the
exchange!

Where we believe things cross into "this probably isn't healthy polyamory" is
through things like blackmail, emotional manipulation, or other coercive
techniques (i.e. "have a threesome and I won't leave you"). If you have any
doubts while writing your prompts/requests or when fulfilling your assignment,
feel free to reach out to us and we can talk through things.

The mods of the exchange don't have a _moral objection_ to these themes and
absolutely will not judge you; they're just not in scope for the exchange.

## How do I participate?

The exchange is being done through AO3. That means you have to have an AO3
account to sign-up or give treats. If you do not have an AO3 account and would
like one, the mods have invites available! Please feel free to reach out to us
for an invite.

## What are the requirements for the exchange?

All participants who sign-up must create either a fanfic or fanart gift in the
allotted time period for their assigned recipient. In exchange, they will
receive a fanfic or fanart gift which matches their requests. Other closely
related fanworks (animations, gifs, etc) may also be allowed as main gifts.
Please reach out to us if you plan to gift one of these before you start your
work!

**Gifts do not have to follow a requestor's prompt exactly, but should match the
requested ships and avoid their do not wants.** For more information on do not
wants, please see the [Do Not Want FAQ](#dnw).

<Aside type="note" icon="document" title="Details">

- **Fanfic**
  - Assigned fics should be at least 1000 words. (We do allow shorter
    [treats](#treats)! More on those below.) There is no maximum word count.
  - Multi-chapter fics are allowed but must be completed when submitted; you
    cannot plan to post updates after the exchange has ended.
  - Fics may be included in another series or collection; however, please make
    sure any fic gifted can stand on its own. Your gift recipient shouldn't have
    to read your 150,000 word slowburn fic to be able to enjoy their gift!
    <br />
    <span class="inlineNote">
      **Note:** Please be sure to add any series or collections which could
      identify you <em>after</em> creator reveals.
    </span>
- **Fanart**
  - completed, clean line art. Color and rendering are not required, but the
    piece must look finished and whole with identifiable characters.
  - No WIPs are allowed.
  - Artists, please check out [this faq](#artist) on artist anonymity.
- Works should not contain any content generated by AI.
- All works should be allowed to be hosted on AO3.
- All works should comply with the requester's do not wants.
- Smut is allowed (nay, encouraged!) as long as it doesn't contain a DNW in the
  request.
- All works should be rated and tagged appropriately.
- You must comment on gifts you receive with a comment that's at least one
  complete sentence. Leaving comments can be difficult, so gif responses and
  memes are okay, but if you use those, please also add a few words to thank
  your gifter for their hard work!
- If you create some other type of fan content (vids, gifs, rotoscopes, etc) and
  would like to participate, please reach out to the mods via tumblr, Discord,
  or email. We'll make sure that your content can be hosted on AO3, and if so,
  let you know what your minimum requirements would be for a main gift or if you
  would need to treat rather than gift a main gift.

</Aside>

## What are nominations?

Nominations are where you help the mods create the tags you want to see in the
event! Because ship tags may or may not exist and can be formatted in so many
different ways, restricting the tags you can use to a tag set helps the mods
ensure a higher possibility of matching requests with offers. But we have no way
of knowing what you want and just slapping "canonical tags" on the exchange
would limit us to already existing tags. Using a Nomination process for our tag
set allows us to tailor this exchange.

Each account can nominate up to 20 tags for the exchange.

Nominations are not an agreement to participate in the exchange. They're only an
indication of "please give me more content for this tag".

**Please be sure to follow nomination guidelines carefully.** You can find out
more in [Tutorials - How to Nominate](/exchange/tutorials/nominate).

## How do I sign up?

Once sign-ups open, start by clicking the `Sign-Up Form` link to the left or
button at the top.

<Aside type="note" icon="document" title="Details">

- **Minimums:** You must have at least 3 requested ships and 3 offered ships to
  sign up. To complete a minimum sign-up you should place one ship in each of
  the 3 request and offer sections.
- **Maximums:** A _maximum_ of 60 ships total may be requested. _There is no
  maximum on your offers._
- **For Both Requests and Offers:** Please indicate whether you are interested
  in fanart or fanfic for your main gift. Please also indicate if you are open
  to treats and what type of treats.
- **For Offers:** In place of offering specific ships, you may also be brave and
  offer to create for "Any" ship, by clicking the "Any" button. Because of the
  way AO3's minimum requirements work, you will need to do this on all three
  offer boxes.

For detailed instructions, please see
[Tutorials: How to Sign-Up](/exchange/tutorials/signups).

</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" icon="star" title="How to Ensure You Get a Match">

The easiest way to make sure you get a match is to check the "Any" option for
**Relationships** on Offers in your sign up. The problem with this might be that
you aren't comfortable with writing or drawing literally any combination
possible. An option that allows you some more control is to keep an eye out on
the Requests Spreadsheet that is posted during sign-ups, and offer for a few of
the requests that are being made that interest you. You can edit your sign-up
after it's submitted up until Sign-Ups close, so be sure to check back
frequently.

</Aside>

For detailed instructions, please see
[Tutorials: How to Sign-Up](/exchange/tutorials/signups).

<a id="dnw"></a>

## What are Do Not Wants (DNWs)?

Very simply put, it's a list of squicks, triggers, or even just dislikes that
you'd rather your gifts and [treats](#treats) not contain. It can be specific
ratings, characters, tropes, kinks, themes, etc, particularly ones that aren't
banned from the exchange. For example, if you aren't a fan of smut you can list
rated E works as a DNW or if you're okay with rated E, but not a fan of works
containing pegging, you can simply list pegging.

Your sign-up should avoid listing DNWs which cannot be reasonably enforced. Such
DNWs include, but are not limited to:

- DNWs that force your creator into a specific gift or prompt ("DNW: Fics that
  do not fit my prompts")
- DNWs that add an unfair burden on your creator or make your gift impossible to
  create ("DNW: Real World AUs or Fics taking place in Thedas (other
  crossovers/mashup only please!)", "DNW: Anders mentioned by name in my Handers
  request.")
- Vague DNWs ("DNW: bad people" - does this mean villains? what makes someone
  bad to you?; "DNW: hardcore BDSM" - what's hardcore to you? further, what's
  BDSM? 24/7 slave/master dynamics? what about rough sex with no formalized
  dynamics?; "DNW: non-vanilla sex" - oh boy. IDK what vanilla is to you. Is
  oral okay? anal? what if it's a gay ship? help!)
- DNWs which pass judgement on the content or people who like it ("DNW: weird
  kinks", "DNW: problematic AUs")

That said, we understand and agree that it can be impossible to be exhaustive,
and we do allow "DNW: kinks other than as requested". This allows you to request
specific kinks and potentially avoid landmines of kinks you're not familiar
with. We realize some exchanges consider this as unenforceable because "what's a
kink"; however, for the purposes of our exchanges, we have decided to take it in
the spirit with which it is intended and interpret it as "no sexual content
other than what's listed as a request or like". If you have any specific
questions about your recipient's DNWs always feel free to contact the mods!

## What happens after I sign-up?

Sign-ups close for everyone on <SignUpsDate client:load />. The mods will start making
matches. If matches are not able to be made, we will reach out to you about
potentially editing your requests or offers to help make a match. Please make
sure to keep a close eye on your emails or DMs and respond to them ASAP.

When everyone has been matched you will receive an email with your assignment to
complete. We hope to have those out (barring any major problems) by

<AssignmentsDate client:load />. You can also watch our social media for a post verifying
when assignments have been sent.

You have from the time you receive your assignment until <DueDate client:load /> to create
and post your work. To post, click the "fulfill" button on your assignment and
post your work as normal. That will automatically associate it with the Exchange
without any extra work from you. You can create a dummy post with a placeholder
for content, titles, descriptions, etc, during this time, but all placeholders
MUST make a reasonable effort to be filled by <DueDate client:load />. That means your
content should be in place with tags and description.

From <DueDate client:load /> until <RevealsDate client:load /> (between when works are due and when they
are revealed to the public) you can continue editing your work, adding tags,
finalizing your title, and updating your description. This week exists to allow
time for extensions, pinch hits, and so the mods will have time to check out the
works to make sure they are complete and do not contain DNWs to the best of
their ability. If there are any issues, mods will reach out to you to take
action ASAP.

When works are revealed on <RevealsDate client:load />, you may NOT post about your work on
social media or another site (revealing it as your own) yet. During this time
you can read and comment on works and make rec lists. Creators can respond to
comments and will automatically be marked as "Anonymous".

Creators will be revealed one week after work reveals on <CreatorsDate client:load />. At
this time you can post on other sites revealing which work is your own!

The collection will remain open so [Treats](#treats) can be added at any time.
You may always feel free to browse past requests and add a treat!

<a id="artist"></a>

## But I'm an artist, what about artist signatures?

We encourage artists to create two versions of their art for the exchange. The
first one should not contain any identifying watermarks or signatures. You may
use a watermark that does not contain your username to help protect your work
from art theft.

Once creator reveals occur on <CreatorsDate client:load />, artists are highly encouraged to
swap out their unsigned/marked work for one with their signature. Our social
media posts that reveals are complete will include a reminder to do so!

<a id="treats"></a>

## What are Treats?

Treats are extra works gifted to participants from people who may or may not
have signed up for the exchange. While Treats must meet all other rules and
requirements, they have relaxed rules on length and style. Treats should be
complete at reveals or (if being added after reveals) when posted.

<Aside type="note" icon="document" title="Details">

- _Fanfic:_ Treats should be at least 100 words. Yes! You can submit a drabble
  treat!
- _Fanart:_ Clean sketches are allowed. You should still be able to tell who the
  characters are, but finished and polished line art is not required.
- _Other Works:_ Must be complete, whatever that means for your media, and able
  to be hosted on AO3. If you have questions about that please contact the mods.

</Aside>

See [Treats & Treatless FAQ](/exchange/treats) for more information on treats.

## I can't complete my assignment. What do I do?

Let a moderator know ASAP, if you don't think you will be able to complete your
assignment so that we can look at giving you an extension. There is nothing
wrong with needing an extension. To request an extension, please complete the
form on _Request an Extension_ (**Coming Soon**) or
[email us at dapolyshipping@gmail.com](mailto:dapolyshipping@gmail.com), but
please be sure to include your AO3 username if you are not emailing from the
email you registered on AO3.

If you can't complete your assignment at all even with an extension for any
reason (also called defaulting) , please let us know _before_ you default on AO3
so that we can find a pinch hitter. We will work to make sure the offer is
fulfilled, either by a volunteer or by a moderator.

There is no direct penalty for a one-time default. However, if the creator who
is creating for you also happens to default, we will not put up your request for
a pinch hit. Participants who are repeat defaulters or who repeatedly miss
deadlines may be subject to mod action.

## What's a pinch hit and who can complete them?

Pinch hits are requests which need someone other than the original assignee to
be completed. They can be completed by moderators or anyone from the community
with an AO3 account willing to take on the challenge. You do not currently have
to be signed-up to the exchange to claim a pinch hit.

Pinch hits may be needed when a participant:

- alerts the moderators there is no way they will be able to complete their
  assignment in time
- does not post a gift by a deadline and has not asked for an extension
- does not meet their extension deadline
- receives a gift that does not fulfill the requirements of the exchange

Pinch hits are posted on social media. Pinch hit deadlines are established as
they are claimed and may fit outside of the other exchange deadlines.

**Works for the exchange will not be revealed until everyone who is eligible has
received a gift!**

## What does this exchange being moderated mean?

Our goal as moderators is to ensure participants receive a gift they're
comfortable with receiving for a character or ship they requested. With that
goal in mind, that means we do reviews throughout the various steps of the
exchange. More specifically:

<Steps>

1. **We review tag nominations to make sure they fit our guidelines.** Tags
   which do not fit our guidelines are posted on social media and noted on the
   nominations spreadsheet so that they can be updated.

2. **We review sign-ups.** We may send emails asking for clarifications on
   [Do Not Wants](#dnw), in particular, but also may recommend that you provide
   OC info or other clarifying information if we think something is very
   unclear. This is not to police what you're asking for, only to ensure that
   what you want is clear for anyone looking to create a gift or treat for you.

   <Aside type="note" icon="document">

   You do not have to have [Do Not Wants](#dnw), but please be advised we will
   email you to ask if you meant not to include them. If you truly have none you
   can say on your sign up "No Do Not Wants" and we will not email.

   </Aside>

   If you are creating for someone and have questions, you can contact the mod
   team and we will be happy to try to get clarifications or more details for
   you!

3. **We make every effort to match you with someone you can create for.** We
   review AO3's automatic matches to make sure we respect any requests to not
   match you to specific people or types of requests. Please do note anything
   essential for us to know in the Additional Info of your offers.

4. **We review works for requested ships, Do Not Wants, and other content we may
   not be sure about.** We cannot guarantee we are 100% accurate, but we do try
   to catch things which you might not want. We will send emails to creators
   _before_ reaching out to the recipient to see how you might like to handle
   any questions we have. Our goal here is to preserve the surprise, so our
   first contact will always be the creator. You can always request we check
   with the recipient if you would prefer that.

   <Aside type="note" icon="document" title="Other Content We May Not Be Sure about">

   You might be wondering what we consider to be "other content we're not sure
   about" in the item above. There is no possible way for us to list everything
   that qualifies, but some examples might include:
   - tropes or potentially triggering content that is adjacent to a DNW

     For example, we may confirm if knotting is an acceptable trope to you if
     you list Omegaverse as a DNW. By the letter of the law, it could be
     acceptable, but it might not be if you consider it to be a main feature of
     Omegaverse AUs.

   - unusual, uncommon, or nonstandard (for Dragon Age) AUs

     An AU where a companion is Inquisitor or evil or playing a vastly different
     role than canon may cause us to question the work.

   - Mashups with other universes

     Mashups (where a fic takes inspiration from another media source) are not
     crossovers and therefore are allowed. However, they may not be as enjoyable
     if the recipient is unfamiliar with the other media.

   Remember we will always do our best to work with creators. If you are aware
   that someone loves the media you used for your mashup (or adjacent ones)
   because you checked out their AO3 or tumblr; if you verified with them on
   anon they're okay with a trope that is adjacent to their DNW; if you've had
   conversations about how much they'd love a certain AU, that's the sort of
   information we'll be looking for when we email to check in!

   </Aside>

</Steps>

#### **Moderators of the exchange do not or cannot:**

- promise you will like your gift

  We do our best to make sure a gift you receive does not hit any do not wants,
  but we cannot ensure that a stranger creates the perfect work for you.

- 100% guarantee a work you receive or that is in the collection will not
  trigger or squick you

  Again, we do our best to make sure your creator respects your DNWs, but we are
  human and may miss things. We also cannot ensure that every piece in the
  collection will suit your tastes.

- enforce unclear or unenforceable Do Not Wants

  For more details see [What are Do Not Wants?](#dnw).

- ensure a participant's age or enforce the request that a minors place sexual
  content in their DNWs

  The moderators and AO3 have no ability (or legal right) to request a legal ID
  from a participant or have any way to ensure any ID collected would be
  legitimate. We must take paticipants at their word that they are over 18.
  Remember that they will need to click through a warning that they are over 18
  or have set their AO3 so that they do not have to click through the warnings.
  So long as you rate and tag your work appropriately you can't be held
  responsible for a minor accessing a work they should not, even if it is gifted
  directly to them.

- force someone to accept your gift or comment

  A recipient may reject your gift at any time for any reason and that is
  _okay_. Your work can remain in the collection even if it is no longer
  attached to your recipient as long as you haven't heard anything from the
  moderators about it being removed for a specific reason.

  Although we do enforce the commenting rule, we do not monitor preemptively.
  Please see [Help! I didn't get a comment!](#help-i-didnt-get-a-comment) for
  more information.

## There's a problem with my gift/treat!

First, we're very sorry we missed something on our reviews. If your received
gift/treat violates a rule of the exchange (including but not limited to
violating your DNWs or not being healthy polyamory), please reach out to a
moderator so we can review the situation and decide what action to take _before_
you contact your gifter in comment or any other way. This allows us to approach
things as a neutral third party for you.

You are always allowed to reject a gift/treat that meets the requirements of the
exchange, but isn't quite what you wanted, even if it doesn't violate your DNWs.
Before you do so, we encourage you to reach out to a moderator so we can review
the situation.

Please be aware that reaching out to a moderator won't necessarily get anyone in
"trouble" or banned from our exchanges! Solutions could be a rewrite, another
gift/treat, or a pinch hit to take the place of the other gift. Don't ever be
afraid to speak up!

## Why hasn't my work been approved?

Approvals for works do take time! As mentioned above, we do at least a minimum
review of tags and potentially skim the works, as well.

We also tend to approve in batches, especially early in the exchange, to help
make sure that people can't see _exactly_ what they will be getting. Because of
this, your work may sit in the collection unapproved for days or weeks if you
are very fast at creation. If you haven't heard from us, rest assured there's
nothing wrong with your gift, and it will be approved as soon as we have enough
works to make it not obvious who is receiving what.

As we get closer to reveals, work approvals do tend to happen sooner rather than
later.

By the way, we don't discourage "gift shaking" or "collection shaking" directly,
but we do like to make it a challenge for you! We think you, as an adult, are
perfectly capable of deciding whether you'd like to shake your gift or not.
However, we also don't want to accidentally spoil the surprise for anyone who's
trying to keep things a surprise for themselves.

## Help! I didn't get a comment!

Although commenting on an assignment received is required, the moderators do not
go out of their way to track comments; we also do not enforce commenting on any
treats received. Commenting is expected to be done on an honor system. The
moderators operate this way for two reasons:

1. if participation is very high it is time consuming and overwhelming to review
   for comments
2. some participants honestly do not care if they receive a comment from their
   recipient or not

We require commenting on a gift received, because it is good etiquette to
comment.

If Creator reveals have happened and you have not received a comment and you
would like to hear from your recipient, please email the mod team. We will
contact your recipient and ask them to comment. They will be unable to sign up
for the next exchange (or possibly any The Hanged Man events) until they
comment.

Once they comment it is _their responsibility_ to email the moderators to let
them know they have fulfilled their commenting requirements so we can lift the
temporary ban.

Please note there may be extenuating circumstances where moderators will waive
the commenting requirement and may still allow someone to sign-up, and these
circumstances may not be shared with you. The mod team takes participant privacy
(including any mod actions they may or may not be subject to) very seriously.

Repeated offenses may lead to harsher punishments.
