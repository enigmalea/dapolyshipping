## Mod Philosophy

Arlathan eXchange is a **The Hanged Man** event which means that it is, in
general, governed by **The Hanged Man's** values and code of conduct.

### What is The Hanged Man?

**The Hanged Man** is an unofficial collective of Dragon Age fans who try to
make a positive difference in the fandom community by giving fans a place to
chat, share and create content, and interact. Our current focus is on
transformative fandom and fanworks, but as (hopefully) more people join us, we'd
love to branch out.

You can read more about **The Hanged Man** on our
[website](https://thehangedmanpub.netlify.app). Since it does impact how we
approach this event and our moderation decisions, please feel free to read our
[Code of Conduct](https://thehangedmanpub.netlify.app/code_of_conduct).

### Our Goals as Mods

In addition to the Code of Conduct linked above, for this event, our goal as
moderators is to try ensure two things:

1. Creators are matched to someone who they've indicated they'd like to create
   for, and (hopefully) enjoy creating for that individual.

2. Everyone who is eligible receives a gift they could reasonably be expected to
   enjoy. At minimum, their gift should not violate their do not wants, feature
   a character or ship from their requests, and attempt to hit on some of their
   likes (if provided).

We realize this is not 100% foolproof. Sometimes matches are not perfect or the
process of creating ends up more difficult than expected. Sometimes creators
miss the mark for their recipient.

Ultimately, even if things are not perfect - if the creation period ends up
stressful or your gift isn't _exactly_ what you expected, we hope that in the
end, you still had fun and want to join us for our next event!

### Communication & Participant Privacy

We are, in general, an extremely privacy conscious moderation team. We will
never share participant contact information without explicit permission. We also
do not believe in “naming and shaming” and therefore, will not share the details
of any moderation action taken against a participant.

However, we will strive to be as transparent as possible with our
communications.
