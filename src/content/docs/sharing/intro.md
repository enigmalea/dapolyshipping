Poly Sharing began as an event heavily inspired by the original
[Pan-Fandom Polyshipping Day](https://polyshippingday.tumblr.com/) which has
gone inactive. It began as a one-day monthly event in 2021, then was updated in
2022 to a quarterly week long event and now is a year round celebration of
positive portrayals of polyamory in the Dragon Age fandom occurring on
[tumblr](http://dapolyshipping.tumblr.com/). Dragon Age fancreators are
encouraged to tag **@dapolyshipping** throughout the year to have us share your
poly content on the blog.

We welcome all fan content featuring often neglected polyships as long as the
ships are from Dragon Age. All forms of polyships are acceptable: non-mutual
(A/B, B/C, but not A/C), OT3s, polycules, non-adulterous open relationships;
they can be platonic, queer, asexual, or straight. Your content can be of any
rating. Our only restriction is that it should be healthy, positive, and
consensual (more info on that below).

Content submitted should be new to the blog (but can be previously created
content) and should feature healthy and positive polyamory. All of the content
submitted queued to post using tumblr's queue feature.

**@dapolyshipping** also accepts inspiration posts. Inspiration posts do not
have to be your own content and can be anything from prompts, challenges, ask
memes, or more! We ask that inspiration posts clearly be for polyships or be
easily adaptable to a polyship; for example, a prompt that says "imagine your
ship" would work, while an art post challenge featuring only two characters
would not.

## What do you mean by healthy polyamory?

In short, we're using the same concept here as we do for our exchange. We try
not to make this difficult, and we use the broadest senses of "healthy" and
"polyamory" possible.

<dl><dt>polyamory</dt>
<dd>the practice of engaging in multiple romantic (and typically sexual) relationships, with the consent of all the people involved</dd></dl>

### Basics

- at least **three** (3) people involved
- **consent** - all parties involved must be willing participants. simply put
  that means no cheating, no coercion or forced relationships or sexual acts, no
  tricking people into the relationship, no cajoling, etc.
- **communication** - this goes hand in hand with the above and should be
  obvious, but in order to be explicit, communication about the relationship or
  sexual act must be open and honest. Obviously, we don't mean "characters can't
  lie", but when they lie they shouldn't be attempting to deceive someone about
  the relationship. For example, Solas can definitely hide that he's Fen'Harel,
  but he shouldn't be telling Cassandra he's only sleeping with her, when he's
  also sleeping with Iron Bull.

## How do I participate?

Post or reblog your polyshipping content and mention **@dapolyshipping** in your
post. You can also [submit](http://dapolyshipping.tumblr.com/submit) directly to
the blog if you don't have a tumblr or wish to remain anonymous.

<u><strong>We accept all forms of fan media, including but not limited
to:</strong></u>

- Fanfiction
- Fanart
- Playlists/fanmixes
- AMVs
- Answers to ask box games/memes/mini-prompts
- Cosplay photos or videos

You can also share posts with poly rec lists, advertising that you're taking
requests, or even opening commissions/requests specifically for polyships!

## Any other rules I should know about?

1. **Please do not submit the same work multiple times.** All fanworks should be
   new to this blog when we're mentioned. It does _not_ have to be something
   created specifically for us or posted to your blog _new_. You can reblog your
   old content and tag us in the reblog to get our attention.
2. **Please only submit your own content.** We consider a tag/mention as your
   consent to feature your content and don't want to reblog your content if
   you'd rather us not share.

   This does not apply to ask memes, prompts, challenges, and other inspirations
   posts. Those are generally created with an intent to share and creators often
   don't have concerns about who reblogs them.

3. For nsfw content please tag using _#lemons_.

If you have other questions, please check the [FAQs](/docs/sharing/faq) first.
