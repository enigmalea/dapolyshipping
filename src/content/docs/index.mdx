<h1>Welcome to DA Polyshipping!</h1>

Dragon Age Polyshipping was created as a way to celebrate polaymorous shipping
within the Dragon Age fandom in all its forms. The account started in Jan 2021
as dapolyshippingday on tumblr, with the intention of hosting a monthly event on
tumblr on the first of each month. In July 2021, we began running Dragon Age
Poly Exchange, a yearly fan exchange hosted on Archive of Our Own. With the
introduction of the exchange, the mods decided to update the tumblr username to
dapolyshipping.

In 2022, the monthly DA Polyshipping Day event was altered to a quarterly DA
Polyshipping Week. The next year brought another change for the event, with the
mods choosing to boost Dragon Age polyamorous content all year long!

  <strong>
    You can tag @dapolyshipping on tumblr or bluesky at any time to have your
    Dragon Age polyamory content shared.
