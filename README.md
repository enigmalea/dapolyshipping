## About

This repository is for the website for Dragon Age Polyshipping. Started by a
pair of like-minded fans in 2021, DA Polyshipping hosts quarterly polyshipping
celebrations on tumblr, and an annual fan exchange on AO3.

Feel free to follow us on our social media and join in on the fun.

## Technology

The website was built using [Astr](https://astro.build) which uses a combination
of markdown, React, javascript, html, and css to generate a static site.
